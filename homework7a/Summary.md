_Either answer "Yes" or describe what you were and were not able to
implement._ [1 point]

Yes

### What was the total amount of time you spent on the assignment?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

6 hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code._ [1 point]

I did not work with anybody on this assignment. 

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not just "Stack Overflow" or "Baeldung") and
**state which ones were particularly helpful**._ [2 points]

### Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What did you think of having instructions in Canvas rather than in the
  project?_
* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _How hard did you find decomposition (determining what helper methods to
  create)?_
* _Did you create tests? Do you think your choice saved or cost you time?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_If you implemented additional milestones, please say so._

_Suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA who was especially helpful,
say so._

I liked this assignment because the Spelling Bee is a game that I play almost daily so this was fun for me. I found the
example of the final product to be very helpful because if I was unsure of a function, I could go try it on the sample. 
I did not mind the instructions being on Canvas because I understand that it is easier to make corrections, but switching
between tabs can get annoying. I found the most difficult part of the assignment to be checking if the word had already
been found, but after thinking about this for a little implementation wasn't too difficult. I did not find it difficult
to determine which helper methods I should write and the bullet points in the instructions made this process easier too. 
I did not create tests but after implementing my methods I ran the program to make sure that they worked as intended. I 
think that this saved me time because creating tests would've taken me more time than just running the program. I learned
how to deal with larger projects that have broader instructions. I also learned then importance of helper methods in code
readability.
